CIS166AA Lesson 9 Assignment: JavaScript Events
Taken @ Rio Salado College, Summer 2023
Instructor: Amy Clubb

Project Instructions:
- Identify 10 different event types (i.e.; a load event, a keydown event, a click event, a mouseup event, etc.). 
- After identifying 10 different types, program these 10 different events into your JS page.
- Use comments in your JavaScript to identify each of the 10 events. The comment should include the number, i.e., "Event #1", and an explanation of what the event does. When your instructor views your code, it should be very clear what the 10 different events are and how they work.
- Add the appropriate code to your HTML page so the events are interactive. When viewing the HTML page, please make the events obvious so that your instructor does not need to hunt for the interactive elements.
